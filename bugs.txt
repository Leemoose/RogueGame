Autoexplore sometimes fails with: RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in comparison
Autoexplore sometimes fails with: AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'pop'

RingOfTeleportation not functional with Teleport moved from skills to spell

unequip button missing on item screen

rings might be broken

need to test what happens if item and skill book give same skill/spell and deal with that
maybe give each skill/spell a source parameter and check against that for removing/adding

enchant scrolls maybe broken
