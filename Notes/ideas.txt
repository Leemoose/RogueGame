    Mental power <=> Will power
    Attribute (either suceptible or resistent)
    Accuracy <=> Dodge
    True damage
    On hit modifiers

Split player into: body, mage, statistics, warrior character

More pathing stuff:
    Could introduce pathing to specific items (might need ctrl+f for items like dcss to be usable)

More UI:
    mini-icons that appear on monster/player tiles to indicate active status effects

Add more comments to code

More Spawning:
    need to add more monsters that fit into new rarity/groups scheme, to allow for more varied generation on later floors
    monsters on deep water need to get special brains to move through deep water

More NPC interaction:
    Maybe introduce affinity (i.e. whether npc likes, dislikes or neutral to player)
        - can be affected by quests or other actions (maybe sensei dislikes if dummy destroyed before giving quest or something)
        - can affect trade prices

On individual item changes, could show changes in stats that would come from equip (compare to currently equipped)

Need a way to choose what to pick up on tiles with multiple items

Potentially change npc conversations <- in progress

Tutorial: 
    - maybe throne room shows basic movement and stairs commands
    - maybe extra room in hub that acts as tutorial for basic mechanics
        - how to pick up items
        - how to equip
        - how to use spells/skills
        - how to attack
        - how to quaff
        - how to read

Star mechanics:
Maybe rework star interest to be based on set thresholds and different actions increase interest 
(ex for green buck picking up money increases interest, which has thresholds for reward rather than thresholds being tied to money)
Could introduce "star quest", special quests once you gain enough interest that give highest tier of rewards, and only allow 1 star quest per run

Star ideas:
    - Green Buck (reward finding money, with more money, monsters drop extra money and discounts at shops)
    - Northern Fist (reward for unarmed combat)
    - Crystal Eye (reward exploration, maybe with increase LOS)
    - Great Forge (reward using rare equipment, maybe with enchantment scrolls)
    - Unbreakable (reward high endurance, reward with damage reduction)
    - Peace Wish (reward exploration without killing, gives experience even without killing)
    - Undying Light (reward being at low health, gives increased stats when low health)

NPC who explains stars to you and gives you a quest to gain a stars interest
