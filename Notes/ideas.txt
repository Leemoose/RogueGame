Some kind of way to path to portals

Update mouse-gameplay by allowing pathing to non-adjacent locations. 

Maybe create a new pathing looptype and standardize autoexplore, stairs pathing, portal pathing, mouse click pathing etc.

Could introduce pathing to specific items (might need ctrl+f for items like dcss to be usable)
