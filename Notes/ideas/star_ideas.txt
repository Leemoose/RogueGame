Star mechanics:
Maybe rework star interest to be based on set thresholds and different actions increase interest
(ex for green buck picking up money increases interest, which has thresholds for reward rather than thresholds being tied to money)
Could introduce "star quest", special quests once you gain enough interest that give highest tier of rewards, and only allow 1 star quest per run

Star ideas:
    - Green Buck (reward finding money, with more money, monsters drop extra money and discounts at shops)
    - Northern Fist (reward for unarmed combat)
    - Crystal Eye (reward exploration, maybe with increase LOS)
    - Great Forge (reward using rare equipment, maybe with enchantment scrolls)
    - Unbreakable (reward high endurance, reward with damage reduction)
    - Peace Wish (reward exploration without killing, gives experience even without killing)
    - Undying Light (reward being at low health, gives increased stats when low health)
