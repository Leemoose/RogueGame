Decide if we want to keep current spell display now that there is a spell screen

Utilize central file with configs better

Fully migrate some skills to spells (maybe decide how to decide difference between the two)

Update monster behaviour to fight if it can't escape because of allies in hallway

Range weapons

Autoexplore picks up items

Ocean:
    Deep water (maybe boats?)
    Add flying

Split item screen description to description and buttons seperately (so it can be reused)

Skill buttons on quickcast selection screen don't work properly for some reason
