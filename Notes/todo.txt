Make new interface with spells to allow for more than 7. Maybe use current setup to show most recent 7 spells used

Make a central file with all configs
    - Branches
    - Max depth
    - Width
    - Height
    - Available monsters + min / max depth + branch
    - Available items + min / max depth + branch

Make a central file for all dictionarys
    - Render to tile mappings
    - Ascaii to tile mappings
    - Ascaii to render mappings (branch specific)

Make a dictionary in static configs mapping gateways to each other (so that can be done automatically)
Add a swap with monster spell
Fully migrate some skills to spells (maybe decide how to decide difference between the two)
Finish splitting out display file
