2 - You look more troubled than the other guards. Can I help you?
3 !quest_given Please, you have to help me. My brother got lost in one of those cursed rifts, and I can't leave my post to search for him. I'm begging you, find him and bring him back. I'll owe you everything if you do.
4 ?quest_completed Thank you... thank you for bringing him back. I feared the worst, but seeing him... it’s heartbreaking. I owe you more than I can ever repay. At least now, he can have a proper farewell. You’ve given us closure, and for that, I am eternally grateful.
